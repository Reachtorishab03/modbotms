`Reddit: in r/findareddit`

Not a subreddit (although we plan on one in the future), but Kallant is a new discord server with this exact thing in mind. We are mostly an educational server but we promote project-based learning/collaboration with space to further your interests, whether its u/aliencup for python projects or u/Rubik_Mind below for blender.

Learn a new skill or field for free from places such as MIT, Harvard, and Columbia. Meet peers, play games, and collaborate together to build a portfolio or a product!

`Asking to promote server`
We made a discord server that promotes MOOC style courses and project collaboration, just wondering if its cool with your staff that I make a post advertising the server.
