Online courses are very common theses days, but once you get knowledge what do you do with it? At **Kallant** we give you the tools and the space to explore the possibilities with your educational interests. Our *main focus* is to connect you with other people that work with your strengths in order to build captivating projects that outline knowledge you have, or knowledge you are learning. With our guidance, we hope to achieve this, and bring you gratifying relationships with your future peers.

`Modmail` - Our Ticket System
If you have any complaints, or issues regarding other members of the server. Please feel free to send a message to @Esko detailing your situation. Staff are focused on handling these tickets as soon as possible, so please use Modmail rather than messaging staff.
`Note:` For those wondering, our mascot Esko is a real dog! We hope to have an instagram or equivalent soon.

`Voting` for #lfg-vote
To keep the server from being to overwhelming early on, we have a voting system for both content and lfg channels. **LFG Voting** (Looking For Group) will be focused on creating channels for your interests besides the ones already listed. Once the channels are created, feel free to use them for their intended purposes.

**Votes Needed** These are subject to change as the server grows.
